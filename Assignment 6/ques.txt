1. Develop a menu driven program for the following operations of on a Circular as well as a Doubly  Linked List.
  (a) Insertion anywhere in the linked list (As a first node, as a last node, and after/before a specific node).
  (b) Deletion of a specific node, say 'Delete Node 60'. That mean the node to be deleted may appear as a head node, last node or a node in between.
  (c) Search for a node.

2. Display all the node values in a circular linked list, repeating value of head node at the end too. For example, if elements present in the circular linked list starting from head are 20 → 100 → 40 → 80 → 60, then output should be displayed as 20 100 40 80 60 20.

3. Write a program to find size of
i. Doubly Linked List.
ii. Circular Linked List.

4. Write a program to check if a doubly linked list of characters is palindrome or not.

5. Write a program to check if a linked list is Circular Linked List or not.
