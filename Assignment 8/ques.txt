1. Write program using functions for binary tree traversals: Pre-order, In-order and Post-
order using recursive approach.

2. Implement following functions for Binary Search Trees
(a) Search a given item (Recursive & Non-Recursive)
(b) Maximum element of the BST
(c) Minimum element of the BST
(d) In-order successor of a given node the BST
(e) In-order predecessor of a given node the BST
3. Write a program for binary search tree (BST) having functions for the following
operations:
(a) Insert an element (no duplicates are allowed),
(b) Delete an existing element,
(c) Maximum depth of BST
(d) Minimum depth of
4. Write a program to determine whether a given binary tree is a BST or not.
